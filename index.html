      <h3>About</h3>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>This site is dedicated to helping young professionals navigate traveling for work, most likely for the first time. As a former admission counselor I was constantly on the road. I remember thinking how helpful it would have been to have some tips and tricks on hand before setting out alone. Before my work as a counselor I had no experience with traveling and found the prospect quite daunting.</p>
        <p>Traveling is a privilege! I want to acknowledge this up front. Employers that require travel of their employees must understand that travel experience as a prerequisite can be exclusionary. These tips are not comprehensive, but they are what I learned on the road and thought might be useful to others.</p>
